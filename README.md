gravitas
========

Inspired by watching Notch start a game for 
[LD30](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/08/20/welcome-to-ludum-dare-30/) in 
[Dart](http://www.dartlang.org), I decided to revisit this language and work on
re-writing a game a had written years ago with Processing. Alas I was not able to devote
the full weekend to the project, and ended up with little more than the base mechanics
and display completed. Regardless, it was a fun weekend project.

The basic mechanic of the game is to utilize gravitational attraction between bodies
to deliver a missile to a designated target. Right now it is more of a demo, where you can
fire missiles from a planet and watch them follow gravitational orbits.
